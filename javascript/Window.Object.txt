Window object represents the browser's window or potentially frame, that a document is displayed in.
--- hum pure brower window pe focus kar rahe hain winow object me
--- effect humko pure broswer me milega

As long as a browser window is open, even if no document is loaded in the window, the 
window object is define in the current model in memory.

All global Javascript variables, functions and objects automatically become members of the windows object.
