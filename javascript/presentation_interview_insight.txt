Properly structuring the presentation or talk which you are thinking of giving is very important:

ABOUT TECH PRESENTATION

You might not have done 1000's of things but if you have completed even 5 things then you
talk about those 5 things

in a 5 min talk

20 sec goest to intro
20 sec thanks for opportunity all that

1 min what the app is
1 min short domo
1 - 2 min what challanges you have faced.


Also 1 things that I read in a Quora article is that an employer knew that a candidate has faked 
his experiences but still on requesting and convincing he aggred to give him a short, later he 
proved himself and got a full time offer.

I an interview I just need to convince the employer that I can do the job, keep me on internship.
Give him emotional touch
