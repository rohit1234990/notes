We have mainly three Areas -
1. Working Area       2. Stagin Area      3. Local Repository

git add -------->>> moves files from working area to staging areas

git commit ------>>> git only takes changes from staging area and move to local repository
                     changes present in working area are not considered.

git push -------->>> takes all commits from local repository and push them to remote repository


[ Origin points to a remote location]
Origin is basically  an ALIAS to remote repository.
====

git remove -v ----------> to have a look what origin is pointing to

[We can add remote]
===================

git remote add hari https:/dkfdkfkkfdfdkf/dfkdfkd/dfkdfk


git fetch --------> pulls changes from remote but doesnt do auto merge

git fetch origin master

git merge ----------> merges changes from git fetch to local repository

===================================================================================

[Git HEAD]
git head is a light weight pointer to recent commit in your branch

git log ----------------> gives commit history of current branch
                          HEAD point to latest commit in this branch
